# Create Session Q&A Document

## Description
Creates a comprehensive Q&A document from session recording transcripts (VTT) and chat transcripts, extracting questions, answers, and key takeaways with proper attribution.

## What it does
1. Reads video transcript (.vtt) and chat transcript (.txt) files
2. Extracts all questions asked during the session
3. Pairs questions with the presenter's answers
4. Includes helpful tips from chat participants with attribution
5. Generates organized key takeaways from the Q&A
6. Formats everything in a clean, numbered markdown document
7. Protects privacy by using first name + last initial only

## When to use
- After hosting a webinar, workshop, or live teaching session
- When you want to create shareable documentation from a recording
- To capture knowledge from Q&A sessions for future reference
- When you need to provide attendees with a written summary

## Usage

### Required files
You need two files from your session:
1. **Video transcript** (.vtt file) - Contains timestamped dialogue
2. **Chat transcript** (.txt file) - Contains chat messages with timestamps

### Basic command
```
I have a session transcript (video.vtt) and chat transcript (chat.txt) on my Desktop.
Create a Q&A doc that lists all questions and my answers, plus helpful tips from
others in the chat with attribution.
```

### The tool will:
1. Read both transcript files
2. Identify all questions from the Q&A portion
3. Extract your answers from the video transcript
4. Pull relevant contributions from chat participants
5. Create a structured markdown document with:
   - Table of Contents
   - Questions organized by topic
   - Your answers
   - Chat participant contributions (attributed)
   - Key takeaways summary
   - Tool recommendations (if applicable)

### Options you can request
- **Number questions**: "Add numbers to the questions (Q1, Q2, etc.)"
- **Privacy protection**: "Use first name and last initial only"
- **Remove sections**: "Remove troubleshooting section" or "Remove unanswered questions"
- **Keep only your insights**: "Remove chat participant contributions, keep only my answers"
- **Extract key takeaways**: "Give me just the key takeaways to copy/paste"

## Output format
The document includes:

```markdown
# [Session Title] - Q&A Document

## Table of Contents
1. [Topic Area 1]
2. [Topic Area 2]
