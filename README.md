# Priya Skills

A collection of reusable skills for Claude Code that I am using help automate common workflows, extract insights from data, and accelerate product work. 

## What are Skills?

Skills are packaged workflows that teach Claude Code (or other agent IDE systems) how to perform specific tasks consistently. Instead of explaining the same process each time, you can simply reference a skill and Claude will follow the documented approach.

## Available Skills

I just published my first one, but stay tuned for more to come.
